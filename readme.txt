A handcrafted design library for Elementor templates

== Description ==

[AnalogWP](https://analogwp.com/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=analogwp) follows a design-first approach on template design for Elementor. We create niche-aware templates with scalable layouts that bring consistency and fine aesthetics into your Elementor compositions.

- 100% Free for personal and client projects
- Sync your library with the latest templates, on a consistent release cycle
- Preview and import templates right from your Elementor Editor
- Multi-niche professional design that makes sense, is scalable and consistent.

#### Insert templates with a single click
Import any of our fine-tuned Elementor templates with a single click, directly into your Elementor page, your Elementor Library, or even create a new page to plug your template into. All media files associated with the template are imported automatically.

#### Save your favorite templates
Save your favorite layouts and filter them for easy access later. Favorites are saved on a per-user basis, so all your editors/administrators can have their own.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do the templates require Elementor Pro? =
No, you do not need Elementor Pro at this point. All the templates that are provided for free are only using the Contact Form widget (which is an Elementor Pro feature). But you can always replace with your favorite contact form plugin.

= What fonts are you using in designs? =
All font pairs in our templates are Google web fonts, we love typography and are always in the look-out for great font combinations.

= Can I use the templates for client projects as well? =
Yes, you can. You can use the templates in any number of personal or client projects. However you cannot re-distribute the templates without our prior consent. You can view the full terms and template licensing here: https://analogwp.com/terms-of-use/.

= How frequently do you add new designs? =
We try to follow a consistent release cycle of two templates per week.

= Will the templates work with my theme? =
Definitely, given that you have Elementor in your theme setup, the templates will get imported and work just fine.

= Where can I get help? =
