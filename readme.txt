Style Kits adds intuitive styling controls in the Elementor editor that power-up your design workflow with unparalleled flexibility.

== Description ==

[Style Kits for Elementor](https://analogwp.com/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=analogwp) (formerly Analog Templates for Elementor) adds a number of intuitive styling controls in the Elementor editor that allow you to apply styles globally or per page.

Stop manually adding / copying / pasting styles across layouts and experience macro control of the most essential aspects of your layout system:

- Body text
- Headings
- Headings and text sizes
- Column Gaps
- Buttons
- Colors and more are coming soon

#### Typography

Edit the styles for Body and Headings and see the effect taking place in your design immediately, right from within the Editor.

#### Column Gap controls

Achieve site-wide spacing consistency through the column gap controls.

Apply the native column gaps on your outer and inner sections and manage the spacing of your layout system from a single place.

#### Save your page Styles as a Style Kit and apply on any page, or globally

All your custom page styles can be saved as a Stylekit and then apply it on any page.

You can also make a Global Stylekit, and it will apply on your entire site.

#### Button Styles

Now you have a single source of control for your different button sizes. Set the button styles on your Style kit and enjoy consistent, site-wide button control.

#### A collection of fine-tuned, Style-kit powered templates. For free.

Trigger the template gallery popup, preview and import any of the templates in our collection.

In most of the templates, styles are managed from the Style Kit panel, so you can experience design-macro control right away.

#### The perfect addition to Elementor Hello Theme

Hello Elementor is a great, lightweight theme but it lacks basic typography controls. Now with Style Kits, you can set the rules for your Typography save them as a global Style Kit and enjoy site-wide typographic control.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do the templates require Elementor Pro? =
No, you do not need Elementor Pro at this point. All the templates that are provided for free are only using the Contact Form widget (which is an Elementor Pro feature). But you can always replace with your favorite contact form plugin.

= What fonts are you using in designs? =
All font pairs in our templates are Google web fonts, we love typography and are always in the look-out for great font combinations.

= Can I use the templates for client projects as well? =
Yes, you can. You can use the templates in any number of personal or client projects. However you cannot re-distribute the templates without our prior consent. You can view the full terms and template licensing here: https://analogwp.com/terms-of-use/.

= What are Style Kits? =
Style Kits (since v1.2) is a collection of the custom Typography and Spacing styles that you have added to your templates, which can be reused with other templates, making the process of creating new templates a lot easier.

= How frequently do you add new designs? =
We try to follow a consistent release cycle of two templates per week.

= Will the templates work with my theme? =
Definitely, given that you have Elementor in your theme setup, the templates will get imported and work just fine.
