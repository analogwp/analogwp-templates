== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working. e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/analogwp-templates` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly..
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Head to 'Style Kits' page from WordPress sidebar menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do the templates require Elementor Pro? =
No, you do not need Elementor Pro at this point. All the templates that are provided for free are only using the Contact Form widget (which is an Elementor Pro feature). But you can always replace with your favorite contact form plugin.

= What fonts are you using in designs? =
All font pairs in our templates are Google web fonts, we love typography and are always in the look-out for great font combinations.

= Can I use the templates for client projects as well? =
Yes, you can. You can use the templates in any number of personal or client projects. However you cannot re-distribute the templates without our prior consent. You can view the full terms and template licensing here: https://analogwp.com/terms-of-use/.

= What are Style Kits? =
Style Kits (since v1.2) is a collection of the custom Typography and Spacing styles that you have added to your templates, which can be reused with other templates, making the process of creating new templates a lot easier.

= How frequently do you add new designs? =
We try to follow a consistent release cycle of two templates per week.

= Will the templates work with my theme? =
Definitely, given that you have Elementor in your theme setup, the templates will get imported and work just fine.

= Where can I get help? =
Our dedicated support team has your back. Please reach out via our website at https://analogwp.com/.
