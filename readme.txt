== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do the templates require Elementor Pro? =
No, you do not need Elementor Pro at this point. All the templates that are provided for free are only using the Contact Form widget (which is an Elementor Pro feature). But you can always replace with your favourite contact form plugin.

= What fonts are you using in designs? =
All font pairs in our templates are Google web fonts, we love typography and are always in the look-out for great font combinations.

= Can I use the templates for client projects as well? =
Yes you can. You can use the templates in any number of personal or client projects.

= How frequently do you add new designs? =
It really depends, but there will be a minimum of two new templates per month, and an optimistic plan that looks for a template per week. Let us know what you think.

= Will the templates work with my theme? =
Definitely, given that you have Elementor in your theme setup, the templates will get imported and work just fine.
